                        <p class="body-text">Keeping track of your funds requires you to be aware of the amount of money
                            in your bank account. It is essential that you comprehend when the deposits you make reach
                            your account. It's fairly straightforward, isn't it? To assist you in staying in control of
                            your account balance, here are some key points from Jayden Wei OGBC fintech banking.</p>
                        <p class="body-text" style="font-weight: 700; color: #3F3E3E; margin-top: 10px;">Business days,
                            holidays and weekends</p>
                        <p class="body-text">Financial institutions have protocols regarding the handling of deposits.
                            If you make a cash deposit, it will be added to your account straight away, and you can
                            start utilizing it instantly. However, for other items that require verification, like
                            checks, usually the money won't be available until the following business day.It is
                            important to bear in mind that even if the Jayden Wei OGBC fintech banking is open, weekends
                            and federal holidays are not considered to be business days. If you make a deposit on a
                            holiday or on the weekend, you should expect to wait longer than usual to be able to access
                            the money.For example, if you submit a check to the bank on a Friday, the funds will
                            typically be obtainable by Monday. Nevertheless, if the Monday after that is a holiday, the
                            money won't be reflected in your account until Tuesday - the first business day after the
                            holiday.</p>
                        <p class="body-text" style="font-weight: 700; color: #3F3E3E;margin-top: 10px;">Checking your
                            available funds</p>
                        <p class="body-text">If you are uncertain as to whether the funds you have deposited are
                            available, you can contact your bank directly to inquire. Jayden Wei quotes that you may
                            also verify by logging onto the Jayden Wei OGBC fintech banking website, utilizing the
                            bank's mobile app, or examining your balance at an ATM.</p>

                        <p class="body-text">If you would like to access your funds quicker than usual, inquire with
                            your bank to see what your options are. For example, a cash deposit will make your money
                            instantly accessible. If you can't make it to the bank during open hours, many banks provide
                            the ability to make deposits via their ATM machines or smartphone app, meaning your funds
                            will be available as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p class="body-text">Are you in a situation where you require quick access to funds for pending
                            payments or unexpected expenses? Most banks will have additional services that can allow for
                            the deposited money to be available to you more quickly. At Jayden Wei OGBC fintech banking,
                            we offer a service called Fast Funds, which allows you to access your deposited funds
                            immediately. For a small charge, you can use Fast Funds to gain access to your finances more
                            promptly.</p>
                        <p class="body-text">This service at Jayden Wei OGBC fintech banking offers three major
                            advantages:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li class="body-text">It allows for immediate access to your full deposit at any time,
                                including weekends and other public holidays.</li>
                            <li class="body-text">It grants priority to your deposit, meaning it will be processed
                                before all other transactions on that day, regardless of when they happened.</li>
                            <li class="body-text">It provides insurance for any check you deposit so that if it is
                                returned, you do not have to pay a returned item fee, and the money stays with you even
                                if the return is due to non-sufficient funds.</li>
