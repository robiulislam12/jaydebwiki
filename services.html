				</div>
				<div>
				  <p class="body-text">Whether you're looking for a high-interest account for short-term savings, or a low-risk account for long-term savings, Jayden Wei OGBC fintech banking will provide all the knowledge you need to make an informed decision. With the right savings account, you can feel confident that your money is safe and secure while still earning you a decent return.</p>
				  <p class="body-text" style="font-weight: 700; color: #3F3E3E; margin-top: 10px;">High-Yield Savings Accounts</p>
				  <p class="body-text">High-yield savings accounts are a type of savings account that allows you to earn a substantial amount of interest on your money. This type of savings account at Jayden Wei OGBC fintech banking is best suited to short-term savings goals, as the interest rate is unlikely to increase over time,</p>
				  <p class="body-text" style="font-weight: 700; color: #3F3E3E;">Money Market Accounts</p>
				  <p class="body-text">Money market accounts are a type of savings account that is very similar to high-yield savings accounts but with a few key differences. Money market accounts at Jayden Wei OGBC fintech banking usually offer a slightly lower interest rate than high-yield savings accounts, but also have a minimum balance requirement that must be maintained in order to remain in the account. This means that you will have to keep a certain amount of money in the account for as long as you want to earn interest on your balance.</p>

				<p class="body-text sub-body">With so many different types of credit cards on the market, it can take time to figure out which one is best for your unique needs and financial goals. To make the process easier, let’s take a look at some of the most popular credit cards available at our banking based on the Jayden Wei review team.</p>

						<img src="./assets/images/secured-card.png" alt="">
						<div class="fintech-baking-item-content">
							<h3 class="forth-heading">Secured Cards</h3>
							<p class="body-text">A secured card is a great option for someone with a poor or no credit history. With a secured card, you need to put down a deposit that will serve as your credit limit. Your security deposit is refundable if you close your account in good standing and pay off your balance in full. The benefit of this type of card is that it's easy to get approved even if you have bad credit or no credit history.</p>

						<img src="./assets/images/rewards-card.png" alt="">
						<div class="fintech-baking-item-content">
							<h3 class="forth-heading">Rewards Cards</h3>
							<p class="body-text">A rewards card may be right for you if you're looking for ways to earn rewards while spending. Rewards cards typically offer cash back on purchases, points towards travel, discounts on specific items and services, or other perks depending on the issuer and the specific card product. The key here is to find a rewards program that works for you and your lifestyle to maximize the rewards you can earn from your spending habits.</p>

						<img src="./assets/images/low-interest-card.png" alt="">
						<div class="fintech-baking-item-content">
							<h3 class="forth-heading">Low-Interest Cards</h3>
							<p class="body-text">Low-interest cards may be the best option for those who already have excellent credit and are looking to save money on interest payments. Low-interest cards typically have lower APR rates than regular credit cards, meaning less money spent paying interest over time if you don't pay off the balance in full each month. Remember that these cards often come with higher annual fees and other associated costs, so be sure to read through all the fine print before applying!</p>

				  <div class="border-line"></div>

				<div>
				  <p class="body-text">Taking out a loan can be intimidating, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the different types of bank loans available. Knowing your options is an important part of making informed financial decisions, so let’s explore the different types of loans and how they can help you reach your goals.</p>
				  <p class="body-text" style="font-weight: 700; color: #fff; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 20px;">Personal Loan</p>
				  <p class="body-text">A personal loan is typically used to cover a wide range of expenses that are not related to purchasing a home or vehicle. This type of loan is unsecured, meaning you don’t need collateral to qualify for one. Personal loans are often used to consolidate debt, pay for home renovations, or fund large purchases like furniture. The amount available depends on your creditworthiness and income.</p>
				  <p class="body-text" style="font-weight: 700; color: #fff; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 20px;">Mortgage Loan</p>
				  <p class="body-text">A mortgage loan helps you purchase a house by providing money for the purchase price. It’s secured by the property itself, so if you fail to repay your loan, the lender has the right to seize it. Mortgage loans usually have longer repayment periods than other types of loans.</p>
				  <p class="body-text" style="font-weight: 700; color: #fff; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 20px;">Student Loan</p>
				  <p class="body-text">
					Student loans are specifically designed to help students finance their education costs such as tuition fees and living expenses while they study at college or university. Student loans generally have lower interest rates than other types of consumer debt, but terms vary widely depending on factors including the type of school attended and whether you are an undergrad or graduate student.

				  <p class="body-text" style="font-weight: 500; color: #999999; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 20px;">Student Loan</p>
				  <p class="body-text">Standard debit cards are issued by a bank or financial institution, and are connected directly to a checking or savings account that you already have with them. The most common type of standard debit card is the Visa or Mastercard logo cards. With these types of debit cards, money is taken directly from your checking or savings account whenever you make a purchase using the card.</p>
				  <p class="body-text" style="font-weight: 500; color: #999999; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 20px;">Prepaid Debit Cards</p>
				  <p class="body-text">Prepaid debit cards are not connected to any existing bank accounts but instead are funded through deposits made by the user into the card’s own account. Prepaid debit cards often come with lower fees than standard debit cards, but they also offer fewer rewards and protections against fraud or theft than standard debit cards do.</p>
